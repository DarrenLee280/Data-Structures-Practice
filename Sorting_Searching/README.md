# Sorting/Searching

## Binary Search
<p> Given a sorted array, binary search starts with the middle element and determines if the element x is less than or greater than the middle element.</p>
<p> If element x is less than the middle element repeat for the lower half of the array. </p>
<p> If element x is greater than the middle element repeat for the upper half of the array. </p>

### example

<p> Given array [10, 20, 30, 50, 60, 80, 110, 130, 140, 170] </p>
<p>                               ^ </p>
